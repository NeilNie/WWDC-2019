 # Under the Hood
 
 I hope you enjoyed that demo. Now please allow me to briefly describe my code.
 
 # Organization
 
 I declared three data structures for this project: `Graph`, `Heap`, and `PriorityQueue`. A heap is essentially a wrapper for the priority queue. I declared a `Vertex` class, which is the building block for the graph. (A node is also known as a vertex in a graph.) The main view controller is called `MapRouteViewController`. The `MapRouteViewController` has a `MapRouteView` as its subview. When entering a city, a `SearchViewController` will be presented. The `SearchViewController` has a `SearchView` as its subview.
 
 # Frameworks and Tools
 
 I created all of the data structures and UI elements myself. I mainly relied on two framesworks, UIKit and SpriteKit. I rendered the map view with SpriteKit. 
 
 # Finally...
 
 I hope you have joyed this playground. I look forward to a wonderful WWDC this year!
